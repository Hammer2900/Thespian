  			 Introducing Thespian

  Thespian is a Python library providing a framework for developing
  concurrent, distributed, fault tolerant applications.

  Thespian is built on the [Actor Model] which allows applications to be
  written as a group of indpendently executing but cooperating "Actors"
  which communicate via messages.  These Actors run within the Actor
  System provided by the Thespian library.

  Concurrent: All Actors run independently within the Actor System.  The
              Actor System may run the Actors as threads, processes, or
              even sequential operations within the current process—all
              with no change to the Actors themselves.

  Distributed: Actors run independently…anywhere.  Multiple servers can
               each be running Thespian and an Actor can be run on any of
               these systems—all with no change to the Actors themselves.
               Thespian handles the communication between the Actors and
               the management process of distributing the Actors across
               the systems.

  Location Independent: Because Actors run independently anywhere, they
                        run independently of their actual location.  A
                        distributed Actor application may have part of it
                        running on a local server, part running on a
                        server in Amsterdam, and part running on a server
                        in Singapore… or not, with no change or awareness
                        of this by the Actors themselves.

  Fault Tolerant: Individual Actors can fail and be
                  restarted—automatically—without impact to the rest of
                  the system.

  Scalable: The number of Actors in the system can be dynamically extended
            based on factors such as work volume, and systems added to the
            Distributed Actor System environment are automatically
            utilized.

  One of the key aspects of the Actor Model is that it represents a
  higher level of abstraction than is provided by most frameworks.  When
  writing an Actor-based application, the concurrency and transport
  layers are completely abstracted, which both simplifies the design and
  allows the concurrency or transport to be changed in the future
  /without/ requiring changes in the Actor-based application.

  The above qualities of Actor programming make it ideally suited for
  Cloud-based applications as well, where compute nodes are added and
  removed from the environment dynamically.

2 Quick Start
═════════════

2.1 Simple Installation
───────────────────────

  Install the Thespian library on your local host system using pip:

  ┌────
  │ $ pip install thespian
  └────


2.2 Starting a Thespian Instance
────────────────────────────────

  Start a default Thespian Actor System on the current host system:

  ┌────
  │ $ python
  │ >>> from thespian import *
  │ >>> ActorSystem("multiprocTCPBase")
  └────


2.3 Hello World
───────────────

  A Hello World example:

  ┌────
  │  1  from thespian.actors import *
  │  2  
  │  3  class Hello(Actor):
  │  4      def receiveMessage(self, message, sender):
  │  5          self.send(sender, 'Hello, World!')
  │  6  
  │  7  if __name__ == "__main__":
  │  8      hello = ActorSystem().createActor(Hello)
  │  9      print(ActorSystem().ask(hello, 'hi', 1))
  │ 10      ActorSystem().tell(hello, ActorExitRequest())
  └────

  The above will create an Actor, send it a message and get a "Hello
  World" response, and then tell that Actor to exit because it is no
  longer needed.

  ┌────
  │ $ python helloActor.py
  │ Hello, World!
  │ $
  └────


2.4 Hello World Redux
─────────────────────

  It's easy to extend the Hello World example to include multiple actors
  which communicate with each other.  This example shows a number of
  additional details:
  ‣ the messages exchanged between the Actors can be anything that can
    be pickled.
  ‣ Actors can create other Actors dynamically
  ‣ Actor Addresses can be passed around
  ‣ Actors remain until they are removed by sending them an
    `ActorExitRequest()'

  ┌────
  │  1  from thespian.actors import *
  │  2  
  │  3  import sys
  │  4  
  │  5  class Greeting(object):
  │  6      def __init__(self, msg):
  │  7          self.message = msg
  │  8      def __str__(self): return self.message
  │  9  
  │ 10  class Hello(Actor):
  │ 11      def receiveMessage(self, message, sender):
  │ 12          if message == 'hi':
  │ 13              greeting = Greeting('Hello')
  │ 14              world = self.createActor(World)
  │ 15              punct = self.createActor(Punctuate)
  │ 16              greeting.sendTo = [punct, sender]
  │ 17              self.send(world, greeting)
  │ 18  
  │ 19  class World(Actor):
  │ 20      def receiveMessage(self, message, sender):
  │ 21          if isinstance(message, Greeting):
  │ 22              message.message = message.message + ", World"
  │ 23              nextTo = message.sendTo.pop(0)
  │ 24              self.send(nextTo, message)
  │ 25  
  │ 26  class Punctuate(Actor):
  │ 27      def receiveMessage(self, message, sender):
  │ 28          if isinstance(message, Greeting):
  │ 29              message.message = message.message + "!"
  │ 30              nextTo = message.sendTo.pop(0)
  │ 31              self.send(nextTo, message)
  │ 32  
  │ 33  if __name__ == "__main__":
  │ 34      hello = ActorSystem().createActor(Hello)
  │ 35      print(ActorSystem().ask(hello, 'hi', 0.2))
  │ 36      print(ActorSystem().ask(hello, 'hi', 0.2))
  │ 37      ActorSystem().tell(hello, ActorExitRequest())
  │ 38      print(ActorSystem().ask(hello, 'hi', 0.2))
  └────

  Running above will create an Actor and send it a message.  That Actor
  will create two other Actors, passing the message along to the first
  which then passes it to the second before finally sending the message
  back to the original requestor.

  The original requestor is code outside of the Actor environment.  This
  external requestor uses the `ask()' API call which assigns it an Actor
  Address just like any other Actor.

  ┌────
  │ $ python helloActor.py
  │ Hello, World!
  │ $
  └────

  ‣ The [Actor Model] at Wikipedia
  ‣ [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ActorsModel]
  ‣ [Akka] is a popular Actor Library for Java and Scala; it is roughly
    the equivalent to Thespian for those languages.
  ‣ [Akka.NET] is an implementation of Akka for the .NET and Mono
    environments making it useable for C# and F# applications.
  ‣ The [Erlang] language has Actor support built-in (see
    [http://www.erlang.org/doc/getting_started/conc_prog.html]).
