<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> Actors</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
At the core, an Actor system is very simple.  An Actor is a standalone
entity that receives messages from other Actors and does one of three
things:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Changes internal state
</li>
<li>Creates other Actors
</li>
<li>Sends a finite number of messages to other Actors
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Importantly, an Actor cannot access internals of other Actors, and it
should not access any globals.  Any information used by the Actor
should be passed to the Actor via a message or else generated
internally.
</p>

<p>
Actors may only communicate with other Actors by sending messages to
those Actors, using known addresses for those target Actors.
</p>

<p>
Note that messages are unidirectional: there is no required
acknowledgement from an Actor that it has received a message.  Actors
are free to exchange whatever messages their implementation dictates
however, including sending acknowledgement messages back to the
sender.
</p>

<p>
In practice, an Actor will perform some sort of application-specific
processing when a message is received.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Actor Addresses</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
All Actors have an Address which identifies them uniquely within the
ActorSystem.  The Address of an Actor is assigned by the ActorSystem
and should be treated by the Actor as an opaque value.
</p>

<p>
Actors will communicate with other Actors using the ActorAddress of
the other actors.  ActorAddress values cannot be synthesized.  The
ActorAddress of other actors can be obtained in one of two ways:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The return value from an Actor create request is an ActorAddress
</li>
<li>Receiving an ActorAddress in a message from another Actor
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The actual value of an ActorAddress is determined by the ActorSystem,
and varies with the implementation of the ActorSystem and the
transport mechanism used.  Actors may print the string form of
ActorAddresses, and they may compare ActorAddresses for equality or
inequality and use them as hash values (e.g. for dictionary keys), but
they should not otherwise depend on or attempt to utilize the value of
an ActorAddress.
</p>

<p>
An Actor can refer to its own ActorAddress using the <code>.myAddress</code>
property.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> ActorSystem</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
The ActorSystem is the framework within which the Actors reside.  The
ActorSystem is responsible for Actor lifecycle management (creating
and terminating Actors) and message delivery functions.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="fig1.png" alt="fig1.png" />
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-3-1"><span class="section-number-4">1.3.1</span> Different Implementations</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-1">
<p>
There maybe several different types of ActorSystem implementations.
Switching from one system to another can be done without requiring
any changes to the Actors that run in those systems: the ActorSystem
cleanly abstracts the scheduling and message delivery to allow the
Actors to be oblivious to those elements.
</p>

<p>
Each implementation may require a different type of addressing, but
as described previously in <a href="#sec-1-2">Actor Addresses</a> the Actors themselves
should treat the ActorAddress objects as opaque.  In addition, an
Actor cannot generate an ActorAddress; it must be given to the Actor
as a result of creating an Actor or in a message passed by another
Actor.
</p>

<p>
Not all implementations are equivalent, however.  Although all
ActorSystem implementations must support the standard Actor API for
Actors to use, some implementations do not support specific features
or functionality, and some implementations are not suitable for use
with the type of applications the Actors implement.
</p>

<p>
As an example, some ActorSystems will run Actors as multiple
threads, whereas other ActorSystems will run Actors as multiple
processes.
</p>

<p>
Another example is an ActorSystem that uses TCP networking to
communicate between Actors v.s. a system that uses local
shared-memory queue structures.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="#sec-8">ActorSystem Implementations</a> section provides detailed
information about the known ActorSystem implementations including
their level of feature support and any known issues.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-3-2"><span class="section-number-4">1.3.2</span> Multiple Systems</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-2">
<p>
There can be more than one ActorSystem running on the current host
system, and there can be ActorSystems running on other host systems
that can coordinate activities with the current ActorSystem.
</p>

<p>
When Actors are created, they can be created within "remote"
ActorSystems.  This locality flexibility does not affect each Actor
implementation at all: the ActorAddress of an Actor can indicate
either a remote or local Actor but the ActorAddress itself is opaque
to the Actor.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="fig2.png" alt="fig2.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
This facility allows for location independence and also provides for
essentially unlimited scalability of the underlying support environment.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-4"><span class="section-number-3">1.4</span> External Communications</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
Actors run in an ActorSystem and communicate with each other using the
message sending capability, but it is also typically necessary for the
external world to communicate with Actors to initiate activity by
those Actors and obtain the corresponding results.  This can be done
by the external system using the following operations on the
ActorSystem itself:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>tell</b> &#x2013; sends a message to a target Actor (as specified by the
target Actor's ActorAddress)
</li>

<li><b>ask</b> &#x2013; sends a message to a target Actor and waits for a
message to be sent back.
</li>

<li><b>createActor</b> &#x2013; creates a new Actor.  There is no <a href="#sec-2-2-4">Parent Actor</a>
for the newly created Actor, so it is referred to as a "top-level
Actor" and it will be managed by the ActorSystem itself and no
other Actor will be notified if the top-level Actor exits.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
To the Actor's themselves the messages delivered via the <code>tell</code> or
<code>ask</code> operations appear to have come from another Actor with an
ActorAddress.  The Actor is unaware that these messages originated
from external code.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="fig3.png" alt="fig3.png" />
</p>
</div>


<p>
More details on the ActorSystem operations can be found in the
<i>ActorSystem API</i> section.
</p>

<h3 id="sec-1-5"><span class="section-number-3">1.5</span> Effects</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<p>
Using an Actor system like Thespian tends to be a transformative
experience in code generation.  Aspects which were previously
difficult to work with: multi-processing, concurrency, inter-process
communications and networking, scalability, fault tolerance and
recovery, &#x2026; &#x2014; all of these are handled by the Actor System itself,
allowing the Actors to focus on the primary needs of the application
itself.

<h4 id="sec-1-6-1"><span class="section-number-4">1.6.1</span> Message Bus (Pub/Sub) Architecture</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-6-1">
<p>
The Actor model provides a higher level of abstraction than a Message
Bus architecture (also known as a "pub/sub" architecture).  An Actor
system can be implemented on top of a message-bus architecture; the
Actors themselves are completely unaware of this implementation
method.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-6-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-6-2"><span class="section-number-4">1.6.2</span> Logging Systems</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-6-2">
<p>
Log-based architectures (e.g. Kafka) are fundamentally "pub/sub"
architectures that use persistent storage for the published messages.
As noted in the <i>Message Bus (Pub/Sub) Architecture</i>, the Actor model is
a higher-level abstraction layer that encompasses the pub/sub
functionality. The Actor model therefore also abstracts a Logging
System with the exception of the persistent storage/replay
functionality of the latter.
</p>

<p>
It is possible to implement message persistence and/or replay
functionality for an Actor system by using Actors specifically
designed to provide this functionality.  The Actor model can thus
easily be extended to mimic a Logging System.

In order to use Thespian, it must be installed in the current Python

within Python by simply importing the <code>actors</code> module from the <code>thespian</code>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
An ActorSystem is created simply by instantiating an <code>ActorSystem()</code>
object and specifying the type or "base" of the ActorSystem, as well
as any optional capabilities of that system.  For example, to startup
an ActorSystem using the "multiprocTCPBase":
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

More details on the explicit parameters for this call are found in
<a href="#sec-1-3">ActorSystem</a>, and the known system bases are describe in <i>ActorSystem
Implementations</i>.
</p>

<p>
Once created, the running ActorSystem reference is stored as a
singleton for the current process.  This means that subsequent
references can either use the direct reference (e.g. <code>asys</code> from the
above) or another <code>ActorSystem()</code> instantiation with no parameters.

process that created them and can outlive that process; Actors in a

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-1">
<p>
Actors can be created by other Actors or by external applications
making a request to the running ActorSystem.  In the former case, the
Actor making the request becomes the "<i>Parent Actor</i>" of the newly
created Actor, whereas there is no parent in the latter case and the
newly created actor is therefore referred to as a "Top-Level" Actor.
</p>

<p>
A Top-Level Actor is created via the <a href="#sec-6-3">ActorSystem.createActor</a> call:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">    &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="org-keyword">class</span> <span class="org-type">MyFirstActor</span>(Actor):

    &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="org-variable-name">mfa_addr</span> = asys.createActor(MyFirstActor)

Actors normally continue to exist and handle messages until they are
explicitly killed.  To kill an Actor, it should be sent an
<a href="#sec-7-3">ActorExitRequest</a> message.

The Actor will receive that message directly on its
<code>.receiveMessage()</code> method, which allows the Actor to make any
preparations for its demise, but it cannot refuse to exit and it
returns from the <code>.receiveMessage()</code>, the Actor will be killed by the
ActorSystem.
</p>

<p>
After the Actor has been killed, the Actor's Address is dead-lettered;
any subsequent messages sent to the Actor's address will be handled as
described in <i>Dead Letter Handling</i>.

any created Supporting Actor.

<p>
The Parent is notified when any child Actors exit.  When the
Parent is killed, the child Actors are killed by default unless
the Parent indicates that they should not be.

If the Actor code handling a message fails, the ActorSystem will

conventional code because it does not have the overhead of lots of
exception checking and error condition handling.

<p>
When writing Actor code, the general philosophy is "fail early";
the ActorSystem itself will restart the Actor in the event of a
failure and possibly retry the message or abort that specific

<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Guidelines for Actors and their messages</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>All ActorSystem messages are derived from ActorSystemMessage.
</li>

<li>Actors should discard messages they do not recognize.
</li>

<li>Actors should allow unexpected or unreasonable exceptions and
errors to cause them to fail.  The ActorSystem will restart the
actor automatically to handle subsequent messages; the message
that caused the failure will be returned to the sender.
</li>

<li>All messages sent by the ActorSystem to an Actor are derived from
the ActorSystemMessage base class.  The messages that an
ActorSystem can deliver to an Actor are:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ActorExitRequest   (see <i>Killing an Actor</i>)
</li>
<li>ChildActorExited   (see <i>Parent Actor</i>)
</li>
<li>PoisonMessage      (see <i>PoisonMessage Returns</i>)
</li>
<li>ActorSystemConventionUpdate  (see <i>Other Actor Systems</i>)
</li>
<li>WakeupMessage      (see <i>Timer Messages</i>)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Most actors can be written very simply and can safely ignore any
and all messages from the ActorSystem.  These messages are
intended to be useable by more sophisticated Actors to handle
unusual or out-of-band events.
</p>
</li>

<li>Use simpleActorSystem for easy testing (and automated unit
testing).  Then use MultiprocQueue for testing with multiple
processes to ensure Actor isolation.
</li>

<li>It is a common practice to have an Actor probe for functional
aspects of the current environment and update the ActorSystem
capabilities based on the results of the probing (see
<a href="#sec-5-10">updateCapability</a>).  Changing the existing capabilities <b>may</b>
result in all existing actors being killed, including the Actor
initiating the change.

<p>
If the probing Actor is restarted, it has no context regarding
the previous probe, but presumably the probe will return the same
result as previous, and an updateCapability call that does not
actually change capability values does not impact currently
running Actors in that ActorSystem.  Care should be taken to
ensure that the probe Actor reaches a stable condition in this
manner.
</p>
</li>

<li>Actors are not intended to create other processes or threads;
attempts to do so may create undefined behavior.
</li>

<li>Actors should not block indefinitely on IO operations; while the
Actor is running in the <code>receiveMessage()</code> method it is not able
to handle other messages, including Actor System internal
messages.  The Actor will appear to be frozen and this will result
in PoisonMessage delivery failures to Actors attempting to
communicate with the busy Actor.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
The Thespian system provides several extended features not present
in a simple definition of an Actor environment.  These features
provide the additional functionality for error-handling,
scalability, and enterprise-level deployment of Thespian-based code.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-1"><span class="section-number-3">4.1</span> Message Delivery</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
Messages are delivered to Actors on a <i>best-effort</i> basis.  This
means that under normal or even most abnormal circumstances, the
ActorSystem effectively guarantees that an Actor's send will reach
the intended recipient (eventually).  However, under extreme
circumstances (grand-mal failure of a multiprocessing system
environment, completely hung Actors, etc.) the ActorSystem may not
deliver a message; this is why it is classified as <i>best-effort</i>
instead of <i>guaranteed delivery</i>.
</p>

<p>
When the recipient is busy, the send request is queued in the
<i>sending</i> Actor's system space.  The sending Actor will retry the
send periodically.  The sending Actor can have multiple messages
queued for different targets, but each target is handled
independently: messages queued for a target are ordered but messages
queued to different targets are handled independently.  Eventually
the Actor's <code>.send()</code> request <i>will</i> block if there are too many
messages queued for the intended target.  This queueing mechanism
provides a "back-pressure" mechanism throughout the system to
prevent too many messages being held in limbo.
</p>

<p>
If the recipient exits before the send can be completed, the message
is redirected to <i>Dead Letter Handling</i>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-2"><span class="section-number-3">4.2</span> Dead Letter Handling</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<p>
If the ActorSystem is unable to deliver a message to the target
Actor (usually because the target Actor has been killed or otherwise
exited), the ActorSystem will route that message to Dead Letter
handling.  The routed message will be wrapped in a <a href="#sec-7-5">DeadEnvelope</a>
message to indicate it's disposition.
</p>

<p>
By default, the Dead Letter handling will discard the message in
question (possibly logging the event).
</p>

<p>
It is possible for an Actor to register for handling Dead Letters.
In this case, the dead-letter handling Actor receives all messages
that could not be delivered to their target address.
</p>

<p>
Dead letter handling should be considered as a fail-safe to prevent
messages from getting lost, but it is recommended that Actors update
their knowledge about other Actors that no longer exist and cease
sending messages to those other Actors.  One reason for this is that
the address of the Actor that no longer exists may&#x2014;at some
point&#x2014;be assigned to a new and completely different Actor; if the
original Actor persisted in sending messages to the dead Actor,
those messages would eventually start being routed to the new Actor,
which would undoubtably cause confusion.

Actors that cannot be started at all will be Dead Lettered by the

non-starting Actor are discarded by the default Dead Letter Handling.

If an Actor experiences a failure (an uncaught exception) when

retry delivery of the message to the target Actor (as describe in
<i>Actor Failure</i>).
</p>

<p>
If the target Actor generates another exception when handling the
message the second time, the ActorSystem will assume that the
message has caused the failure and will wrap the message in a
<code>PoisonMessage</code> wrapper object and send it back to the sender of
the original message.  The Actor experiencing the exception is
still live, and other messages will still be delivered to it.

Actors created by the external environment are called "Top-Level
Actors" and are unique in that they have no "parent" Actor (see
<i>Parent Actor</i>).  Since there is no Parent Actor, there is nowhere to
send a ChildActorExited message when the Actor dies and therefore
there is no allowance for restarting Top Level Actors.

Messages sent to a Top Level Actor that has died will still be
redirected to the Dead Letter Handler (see <i>Dead Letter Handling</i>).

<h3 id="sec-4-6"><span class="section-number-3">4.6</span> Named Actors</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-6">
<p>
Most Actors are created and subsequently referenced by the
ActorAddress. This ActorAddress can be used by any Actor in the
system to send a message to that created Actor.
</p>

<p>
At times, however, it may be convenient to very explicitly refer to
a single Actor in the entire system&#x2014;a Singleton&#x2014;without knowing
the Address of that Actor.  To support this, Thespian allows the
creation of "Named Actors" where the name given uniquely identifies
the Actor.
</p>

<p>
The initial Actor creation request with the name will create the
requested Actor, but the Actor System will remember the Actor
associated with that name andall subsequent Actor creation requests
with the same name will return the originally created Actor.
</p>

<p>
It is possible to create any number of Named Actors in the system,
although it is the responsibility of the creators to manage the
namespace of those Actors.
</p>

<p>
There are a couple of disadvantages to Named Actors that must be
considered relative to their convenience:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>All Named Actors are similar to <i>Top-Level Actors</i> in that they
are managed by the Actor System itself rather than a Parent
Actor and therefore there is no notification when a Named Actor
exits, and any messages sent to a Named Actor that has exited
will be sent to the Dead Letter Handler.
</li>

<li>Interaction with Named Actors can be slower than for standard
Actors because of the need to perform global lookup and
coordination based on the name.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
It is recommended (but not required) that only the top-level,
coordinating Actors be Named Actors and that most Actors in the
system be

<h3 id="sec-4-7"><span class="section-number-3">4.7</span> Timer Messages</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-7">
<p>
Normally Actors respond to messages sent to them by other Actors,
but sometimes an Actor would like to run again after a timed delay.
While it is possible for the Actor to sleep internally, this will
prevent it from responding to other messages and cause messages to
be queued causing eventual delivery failure (see <i>Message Delivery</i>).
</p>

<p>
To avoid this, each Actor has a <code>.wakeupAfter()</code> method that can be
called with a specified Python <code>timedelta</code> value.  The ActorSystem
will schedule the delivery of a <code>WakeupMessage</code> after that time
period has elapsed.  Multiple wakeups can be pending for an Actor at
any single time, and the delivery of the <code>WakeupMessage</code> is
interleaved into the normal incoming message stream for the Actor.
</p>

<p>
There is no provision for cancelling a pending wakeup; the Actor
should simply ignore the <code>WakeupMessage</code> when it is received.

If specified appropriately, multiple instances of an Actor can be
created which share the same ActorAddress; this is known as an
Actor Troupe.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Messages sent to the ActorAddress associated with the Troupe may
be handled by any of the members of the Troupe,

<li>A message will be delivered to only one member of the Troupe, but
the handling of that message will be performed independently and
asynchronously to any other message being handled by a member of
the Troupe.
</li>

<li>All members of the Troupe are local to each other (i.e. exist
under the same ActorSystem).
</li>
</ul>

The Actor Troupe allows for scalability and parallelization of
individual Actor functionality.  Conversely, the use of a single
Actor (instead of a Troupe) ensures single-threaded, synchronous
handling of messages for that Actor.

<h3 id="sec-4-9"><span class="section-number-3">4.9</span> ActorSystem Capabilities</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-9">
<p>
Actors can stipulate the requirements of the ActorSystem that they
will run in by matching "Capabilities" of the ActorSystem.  Each
ActorSystem has a set of Capabilities specified as a key/value
dictionary.  This dictionary is passed to an Actor's
<code>ActorSystemCapabilityCheck()</code> static method, which examines the
capabilities and returns <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> to indicate whether or
not the current ActorSystem is viable for the Actor.
</p>

<p>
If the current ActorSystem is rejected for creating the Actor, the
ActorSystem will pass the Actor Create request to other ActorSystems
to see if any of those systems can create the requested Actor.
</p>

<p>
The Capabilities of an ActorSystem are free form and the actual
capability keys and values are determined by whatever agent
specifies them.

All Thespian ActorSystem instances automatically supply a set of
common capabilities described in the <i>Common Capabilities</i> section.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-10">
<p>
The current ActorSystem can communicate with other ActorSystems to
coordinate Actor activities as described in <i>Multiple Systems</i>.  To
support this, the ActorSystems communicate on known transport
addresses to form a "Convention" of ActorSystems.
</p>

<p>
When new Actors are created, the <i>ActorSystem Capabilities</i> of the
ActorSystems that are part of the Convention are used to determine
where to start up the requested new Actor.
</p>

<p>
Remote ActorSystem implementations can be different than the local
ActorSystem as long as they properly handle communications between
the two ActorSystems and the Actors contained therein.
</p>

<p>
Actors can also register to be aware of when remote ActorSystems
enter or exit the convention.  Registered Actors will receive an
<a href="#sec-7-6">ActorSystemConventionUpdate</a> message for these events.  Actors
register for these updates using the
<a href="#sec-5-7">notifyOnSystemRegistrationChanges</a> API call.

<p>
The standard Python logging can be used with the Thespian Actor
system, although there are some Thespian modifications to logging that
improve the logging experience using Thespian.
</p>

<p>
The 'logging' parameter of the system capabilities passed to the Actor
System (see below) will specify the primary logging configuration for
Thespian and corresponding Actors (regardless of where the logger is
obtained).
</p>

<p>
The functionality provided by logging in the Thespian environment
possibly includes sending log messages to a central Logging actor.
This is needed because the standard Python logging is not
multi-process safe and attempts to use it as-is will result in missing
or duplicated log messages.

In addition, the Convention Manager Actor System receives all log
messages from any conference member that is of <code>WARNING</code> level or above.

<h3 id="sec-4-12"><span class="section-number-3">4.12</span> Actor Code Distribution</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-12">
<p>
The Thespian ActorSystem provides an feature to specify the code
used for Actor implementations.
</p>

<p>
By default, an Actor implementation is obtained by importing from
the current environment and then passing that object to a
<code>createActor()</code> call.  When used in this default manner, all of the
<code>.py</code> sources used to implement Actors must be in the import path of
the Thespian ActorSystem itself.
</p>

<p>
With the Code Distribution feature provided by Thespian it is
possible to load specific Actor code as provided by a (possibly
encrypted) zipfile.  The zipfile can be dynamically loaded into an
already-running Thespian ActorSystem.  This provides a number of
advantages:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Thespian ActorSystem can be distributed and activated as a
standalone element.  The code for Actors to be run within the
system can be distributed separately.
</li>

<li>Actor implementation code can be protected by encryption,
allowing that code to run only when the proper decryption key is
provided.  This provides both distribution security (Python
source files are not readable by anyone with access to the
computer on which they are installed) and validation of
authorization to interact with and execute the Actor code
(especially in cases where the ActorSystem runs with elevated
privileges).
</li>

<li>Multiple unrelated sets of Actors can share the same ActorSystem
without adverse interactions.
</li>

<li>Running Actor implementations can be updated without requiring
the entire ActorSystem to be stopped and restarted.  This is
especially useful when the ActorSystem is hosting multiple
different and independent sets of Actors.
</li>

<li>Multiple instances of the same set of Actors can be running in
the same ActorSystem simultaneously.  This is especially useful
when upgrading to a new version of a set of Actors where all new
messages are directed to the new Actors while allowing all
messages circulating between the older Actors to drain; in this
scenario there is no downtime to customers when upgrading an
Actor implementation.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
When the Thespian Actor Code Distribution mechanism is used in a
multi-ActorSystem configuration (e.g. cooperating ActorSystems
between several computers), it is only necessary to load the zipfile
into one ActorSystem.  The different ActorSystems will automatically
pull the zipfile from the source system to support a createActor
operations that would occur in that other ActorSystems (e.g. due to
system capabilities or actor requirements).  This mechanism allows
the following additional benefits:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Actor code distribution can be done by simply loading the new
code version into a single ActorSystem (usually the convention
leader) and all other ActorSystems will automatically update
with that code on an as-needed basis.
</li>

<li>Actor implementation synchronization.  The createActor will
automatically synchronize the current zipfile version to the
target ActorSystem before instantiating the new Actor, thereby
ensuring that the local Actor is communicating with an
up-to-date version of the remote Actor.  There is no longer a
risk that a newer version of an Actor will attempt to
communicate with a remote Actor instance that is out-of-date and
encounter version-related problems.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
The Actor API is the set of operations that a running Actor can
perform.  Thespian implements this API as a set of methods on an
<code>Actor</code> baseclass that all running Actors should subclass.
</p>

<p>
The Actor API is made available by importing the <code>thespian.actors</code>
module.
</p>

<p>
Each Actor is represented by an Actor baseclass:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

Versioning of the Actor API and the ActorSystem are described in
<i>ActorSystem Capabilities</i>.

</pre>
</div>

<p>
This method is the primary entry point into the Actor to handle
received messages.  Each subclass should override the base Actor
receiveMessage() method as appropriate.  The <code>message</code> argument is
the message being received, and the <code>sender</code> is the ActorAddress of
the Actor (or <i>External Communications</i> endpoint) sending the
message.
</p>

<p>
The message can be discarded once it has been handled.  As
described previously in <a href="#sec-1-1">Actors</a>, there are three things an Actor can
do when handling a message:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Update internal state
</li>
<li>Create a finite number of other Actors
</li>
<li>Send a finite number of messages to other Actors
</li>
</ol>

<p>
If the processing of the message causes an exception, the failure
will be caught by the ActorSystem and the message may be retried or
returned to the sender as described in <i>PoisonMessage Returns</i>.  Note
that the <i>original</i> copy of the receive message is passed to the
Actor with each attempt; if the Actor modifies the message before
failing with an exception, the retried or Poison-returned version
will contain the modifications made by the original attempt.

</pre>
</div>

<p>
This method is called by the Actor to create a new Actor
represented by the specified <code>actorClass</code>.  The <code>actorClass</code> may be
specified as either a class object or as a module-qualified string
(e.g. ~"foo.bar.BarActor"~ will search for <code>class BarActor</code> in the
<code>bar.py</code> in the <code>foo</code> directory).  The InvalidActorSpecification
exception will be thrown if the actorClass is not specified in a
valid manner.
</p>

<p>
The optional <code>targetActorRequirements</code> argument is a value that
will be passed passed to the <a href="#sec-5-9">actorSystemCapabilityCheck</a> to use for
validating whether the Actor can be started within the current
ActorSystem environment (see <i>ActorSystem Capabilities</i>).  The value
specified for this argument can be anything the target Actor's
<code>actorSystemCapabilityCheck()</code> method can understand, although
typically it is a Python dictionary.
</p>

<p>
The <code>globalName</code> argument may be specified (as an arbitrary string)
to create a <i>Named Actors</i> instance.
</p>

<p>
The context for the created Actor will be the context under which
the Thespian system was started.  <span class="underline">This means that if the Thespian
system was started as root, then all Actors will run as root.</span>
</p>

<p>
The source for the <code>actorClass</code> to be created is established by
the current Actor, relative to any <a href="#sec-6-8">loadActorSource</a> operation that
apply to the creating Actor itself:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If an Actor class is specified directly, that class is obtained
via import operations.  These import operations use the lookup
search path that already use a searchpath that contains any
loaded actor source operations.
</li>

<li>If a module-qualified string specifies the <code>actorClass</code>, then
the lookup of that class will use the same source hash lookup
path that the Actor itself came from.
</li>

<li>It is not possible to specify an alternate source file hash
when performing a <code>createActor()</code> call from within an Actor
(only the ActorSystem <code>createActor()</code> method can do that).
</li>

<li>If the target Actor must be instantiated in a separate
ActorSystem and that ActorSystem does not have the
loadActorSource for the target Actor available, it will
automatically obtain that loadActorSource file from the current
system and then start the target Actor from that source.  This
can be used as a code distribution methodology for the
ActorSystems' environment.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The return value of this method is the ActorAddress of the
newly-created Actor.  Note that this address may be provided even
before the target Actor is instantiated and is ready for handling
messages.  The ActorSystem will automatically buffer any messages
sent to the new Actor until that Actor is ready; the creating Actor
is free to send messages immediately on completion of this request
and does not need to be concerned with the asynchronous startup
aspect of the target Actor.  However, due to this asynchronous
startup, it is possible that the new Actor cannot be started at
all; in this event all messages intended for the new target Actor
will be handled as described in the <i>Dead Letter Handling</i> section.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-3-1">
<p>
The parent for a Named Actor (created when the <code>globalName</code> argument
is specified) is the ActorSystem itself, rather than the requesting
Actor.  This is because there may be multiple createActor requests
for the same global name and they should all return the Address of
the same Actor, but an Actor cannot have multiple Parents.
</p>

<p>
A Named Actor persists as long as it is not killed (via an
ActorExitRequest) and can be referenced by any Actor requesting a
create with the same globalName.
</p>

<p>
When a Named Actor exits, only the ActorSystem is aware of the
exit; there is no <a href="#sec-7-4">ChildActorExited</a> notification sent to any Actors
that requested the creation of the Named Actor.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-3-2">
<p>
There are a few issues to be aware of when creating Actors:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>When creating an actor using a string specification of the Actor
Class, the name <b>must</b> be a fully-qualified module specification
and not simply the name of an ActorClass in the current source.

<p>
While the latter would be convenient, it is not possible for
remote processes to have access to the current source frame to
load these Actors.  One solution is to use a class reference
rather than a string (but see the next issue).
</p>

<p>
The InvalidActorSpecification exception will be thrown if the
actorClass is not specified in a valid manner.
</p>
</li>

<li>Actor classes must either have been in the system path when the
ActorSystem was created, or they must exist in a loaded Actor
Source (see <a href="#sec-6-8">loadActorSource</a>).  Many ActorSystems use separate
processes to manage and create new Actors, so any changes in the
current process after the ActorSystem process is started up will
not be visible to the latter.

This is the method used to send a message from the current Actor
to another Actor as identified by the <code>targetAddress</code>.  The
<code>message</code> can be anything the current Actor desires, although most
ActorSystem implementations will require that the <code>message</code> can be
pickled by the Python <code>pickle</code> utility.
</p>

<p>
There is no response to the send, and the message is delivered to
the target asynchronously.  There is no guarantee that the target
has received the message by the time the <code>.send()</code> method returns.
The ActorSystem delivers the message at some point by best-effort,
sending the message to <i>Dead Letter Handling</i> if it cannot be
delivered.

The <code>timePeriod</code> specifies a Python <code>datetime.timedelta</code> period.
When this time period has expired, the ActorSystem will deliver a

This is a <b>static</b> method provided by the Actor object that is
called to see if the Actor can be created within the context of the
current ActorSystem.
</p>

<p>
The <code>capabilities</code> argument specifies the key/value dictionary of
capabilities of the current ActorSystem.  ActorSystem capabilities
are free-form and are determined solely by agents specifying those
capabilities (see <i>ActorSystem Capabilities</i>).
</p>

<p>
The optional <code>requirements</code> argument specifies the additional
requirements that the creating Actor specified in the
<code>.createActor()</code> call.
</p>

<p>
The <code>.actorSystemCapabilityCheck()</code> should return <code>True</code> to indicate
that the Actor may be created in the current ActorSystem, or <code>False</code>
to indicate otherwise.  It is free to base this decision on any,
all, or none of the capabilities or requirements provided.
</p>

<p>
This static method may also be called to re-validate the Actor's
viability if the capabilities of its ActorSystem are updated (as
described in the <a href="#sec-5-10">updateCapability</a> section), and if it returns False
then the existing Actor will be killed with an <a href="#sec-7-3">ActorExitRequest</a>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-9-1">

To facilitate easy specification of requirements, there is a

specify that a capability must be present in the system capabilities
and that it's value must be "truthy" (i.e. some expression that
evaluates as truthful).  The decorator can be repeated multiple
times for a single Actor and it may be used in conjunction with an
actual <code>actorSystemCapabilityCheck()</code> method.

<p>
For example:

<p>
Note that the value of 5 is "true", as compared to a value of 0
that is "false".  Any value that would represent as true in an <b>if</b>

(e.g. ~"foo.bar.BarActor"~ will search for <code>class BarActor</code> in the
<code>bar.py</code> in the <code>foo</code> directory).
</p>

<p>
The <code>targetActorRequirements</code> argument is a value that will be
passed to the <a href="#sec-5-9">actorSystemCapabilityCheck</a> to use for validating
whether the Actor can be started within the current ActorSystem
environment (see <i>ActorSystem Capabilities</i>).  The value specified
for this argument can be anything the target Actor's
<code>actorSystemCapabilityCheck()</code> method can understand, although
typically it is a Python dictionary.
</p>

<p>
The <code>globalName</code> argument, if specified, should be a string
specifying the "name" of the Actor within the ActorSystem.  As
describe in <i>Named Actors</i>, this name allows the Actor to be uniquely
identified and referenced in a manner additional to the
ActorAddress of the actor.
</p>

<p>
The <code>sourceHash</code> argument, if specified, indicates a source file
which should be prepended to the import path when attempting to
load the <code>actorClass</code> source and start the Actor.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The source file must previously have been loaded by the
<a href="#sec-6-8">loadActorSource</a> operation.
</li>
<li>If not specified, then the <code>actorClass</code> is expected to be found
on the standard path.  If the <code>sourceHash</code> value does not match
any loaded sources then an <code>InvalidActorSourceHash</code>
exception will be thrown.
</li>
<li>If the <code>globalName</code> argument is already specified and an Actor
is running under that name, this argument is ignored, even if
the running Actor did not come from the specified source file;
otherwise the Actor started and assigned the global name.
</li>
<li>The specified loaded source file is merely prepended to the
search list.  If the loaded source file does not contain source
for the specified <code>actorClass</code> but the standard path
environment for the running Thespian ActorSystem <b>does</b> contain
source for that <code>actorClass</code>, then the latter will be used to
instantiate the new Actor.
</li>
<li>The source specified by the hash must have been loaded into the
current Actor System, or previously have been obtained from a
remote Actor System; this operation will <b>not</b> cause a query of
remote actor systems to locate the source if the Actor cannot
be found locally (the behavior of a <code>createActor()</code>
call made by an Actor itself may be different).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This method may throw the following exceptions:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>NoCompatibleSystemForActor</code> if it is unable to find an
ActorSystem whose capabilities match the Actor's requirements.

<li><code>InvalidActorSourceHash</code> if a source hash is specified that does
not match any currently loaded source.

The <code>loadActorSource()</code> method is used to load a (possibly
encrypted) zipfile containing Python source code in standard Python
zipimport format (via PEP302<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> methodologies).  The return value

zipfile that can be used in subsequent <a href="#sec-5-3">createActor</a> calls to

<p>
Although a plaintext zipfile may be loaded, it is highly recommended
that production environments encrypt the zipFile using some sort of
encryption methodology.  The reasons for this are discussed in the
<i>Security Considerations</i> section below; when an encrypted zipfile is
loaded it is first decrypted and/or authorized as described therein.
</p>

<p>
The <code>fileref</code> argument can be a string specifying an input file path
or it can be a file-like object.  If the <code>fileref</code> is invalid or
specifies a corrupted source file, then the returned sourceHash it

feedback (excepting perhaps the <code>/tmp/Thespian.log</code> logfile).

<h4 id="sec-6-8-1"><span class="section-number-4">6.8.1</span> Source Loading Issues</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-8-1">
<p>
Although the <code>loadActorSource()</code> functionality works quite well,
there are a few scenarios that can cause difficulties:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Loaded sources containing or relying on object libraries.  The
<code>loadActorSource()</code> functionality affects the Python module
lookup, but it does not affect object file lookups that would
need to be performed for native object libraries.  In addition,
object libraries are specific to their build environment and may
not work in all target environments.  If the loaded source
simply <b>refers</b> to an externally available library
(e.g. PyOpenSSL python package refers to <code>/usr/lib/libssl.so</code>)
then this may work if the proper object library has been
installed on the target system by other means (i.e. not via the
<code>loadActorSource()</code> call.
</li>

<li>Sources containing other PEP302 path importers may not work
correctly when used in conjuction with the <code>loadActorSource()</code>
PEP302 importer.  As an example, the <code>loadActorSource()</code>
importer prefixes loaded modules with the Source Hash associated
with those modules to ensure uniqueness.  This is not always
compatible with other PEP302 importers.

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The <code>six</code> package (providing Python2/Python3 compatibility)
uses a PEP302 importer to manage moved packages.  This
functionality of the <code>six</code> package is broken by the
<code>loadActorSource()</code> Source Hash prefixing. To avoid this
<code>loadActorSource()</code> processing handles <code>six</code> as a special
case and <i>does not</i> prefix <code>six</code> with any Source Hash.

<p>
The assumption is that <code>six</code> is a mature and unchanging
package and a global version is acceptable for all loaded
sources (and that a working <code>six</code> importer is preferrable to
a non-working importer).
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>The <code>importlib</code> package has a subtle flaw that is not compatible
with the Source Hash prefixing performed by <code>loadActorSource()</code>.
To work around this problem Thespian provides an updated version
of <code>importlib</code>; use " <code>import thespian.importlib as importlib</code> "
instead of just " <code>import importlib</code> " in Actor sources that
will be loaded via <code>loadActorSource()</code>.
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-6-8-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-6-8-2"><span class="section-number-4">6.8.2</span> Security Considerations</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-8-2">
<p>
When <code>loadActorSource()</code> is not used, the source for all
instantiated Actors must come from the existing Python import path
in the context of the Thespian ActorSystem.  In this configuration,
it is the System Administrator's responsibility to provide
reasonable security and protection against code injection attacks
(e.g. by using a virtualenv in a protected directory environment).
</p>

<p>
In order to prevent code injection attacks from being used with
<code>loadActorSource()</code> techniques, the ActorSystem must be able to
validate the following for each set of code loaded:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The source file has not been tampered with.
</li>
<li>The source file is acceptable to run in this ActorSystem.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
To achieve this protection, an Actor can register itself with the
system to handle authorization and/or description of
<code>loadActorSource()</code> inputs.  This Actor is referred to as the Source
Authority Actor.  Any input subsequently provided to
<code>loadActorSource()</code> is first passed to this Source Authority Actor.
The Source Authority Actor can perform any validation and/or
decryption of the input that it would like to and then sends back
either an error or the authorized source in a form that can be
utilized by the local ActorSystem.
</p>

<p>
There can be only one Source Authority Actor registered with an
Actor System at any one time.  Any Actor can register itself as the
new Source Authority; it is assumed that the previous authorization
of that Actor validated that it is allowed to run in the system and
therefore assume Source Authority responsibilities.  Note that in
highly paranoid environments, the initial Source Authority can be
used to authorize the next Source Authority, and this process can be
repeated as indicated by the level of paranoia to further obfuscate
the manner in which the Source Authority is established.
</p>

<p>
By default, at Actor System startup time, there is no Source
Authority, thus allowing any <code>loadActorSource()</code> input to be loaded
and utilized.  This is convenient for debugging and simple local
applications, but not recommended for production deployments.
Typical best practices for production initialization of a Thespian
environment are to startup the ActorSystem and then immediately load
a Source Authority that will validate all subsequent sources loaded
into that system.
</p>

<p>
Note that it is possible to disable the <code>loadActorSource()</code>
functionality entirely by registering an Actor as the Source
Authority that will reject all loaded sources.

<ol class="org-ol"><li><a id="sec-6-8-2-1" name="sec-6-8-2-1"></a>Multi-System Source Authorization<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-6-8-2-1">
<p>
The Source Authority registration is unique to an Actor System.
Different Actor Systems in a <i>Multiple Systems</i> configuration can each
have a separate Source Authority that may perform different
authorization techniques.  However, as described in <i>Actor Code
Distribution</i>, Actor Systems joined together in a Convention can
exchange sources on demand to satisfy Actor creation requests.
sources exchanged between Actor Systems in this manner are not
subject to further <b>validation</b> after the initial load on the
original system (although the local ActorSystem can choose the level
of sharing it wishes to perform; see the <b>AllowRemoteActorSources</b>
capability setting in the <i>Common Capabilities</i> section).
</p>

<p>
This functionality allows for maximum flexibility in handling
different deployment environments:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In an environment where the Convention Leader ActorSystem is the
centralized command-and-control system and sources should only be
loaded on that system, the other ActorSystems can be initialized
with a Source Authority that rejects all <code>loadActorSource()</code>
attempts and therefore can run only sources provdied by the
Convention Leader.
</li>

<li>In an environment where all ActorSystems are trusted equally and
new Actor source can be loaded via any system, they can all
utilize the same Source Authority as loaded into each Actor system
at the time it is started.
</li>

<li>In a loose confederation of trusting ActorSystems, each
ActorSystem can load its own Source Authority to control sources
loaded via that system, while still sharing sources loaded on any
system.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is important to note that in all configurations, different loaded
sources are essentially independent, regardless of the method by
which they are loaded and validated.  The only way for one source
load to access code in another source load is by issuing a
<code>createActor()</code> request using the known name of an Actor in the
other source load, or by being passed the ActorAddress of an already
running Actor in the other source load via independent means.

This effect of this call on running Actors' ability to access the
unloaded source via imports or subseqeuent Actor creation is
indeterminate: in some system bases this would fail, whereas in
other bases this would succeed.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
One of the convenient aspects of an Actor architecture is that the
Actors themselves are insulated from and agnostic to any particular
transport type: the Actor System provides the message delivery and
underlying Actor support functionality.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The implementation of the Actor System can be changed or
redesigned without the Actors themselves needing to change.
</li>

<li>Different implementations can be chosen for different circumstances
to meet the needs of that particular circumstance.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Actors themselves interact with the ActorSystem via the normal
<code>.send()</code>, <code>.createActor()</code>, <code>.receiveMessage()</code> methods defined for
the Actor.
</p>

<p>
The external environment can interact with the Actors by making
requests via the ActorSystem object itself.  In addition, the Actor
System must be initially created to provide an environment for all
Actors that are subsequently run within that Actor System; this
creation is the responsibility of code in this external environment.
When external code calls the <code>ActorSystem()</code> constructor, an Actor
System is started if one is not already running.
</p>

<p>
An argument may be passed to the <a href="#sec-1-3">ActorSystem</a> constructor to specify
the systemBase (a.k.a Actor System implementation) that should be used
for starting the Actor System if one is not already running; if an
Actor System is already running, this argument is ignored.  If no
argument is specified and no Actor System is running, the default
<a href="#sec-8-2">simpleSystemBase</a> Actor System will be started.

<h3 id="sec-8-1"><span class="section-number-3">8.1</span> Common Capabilities</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-8-1">
<p>
As described in <i>ActorSystem Capabilities</i> each ActorSystem has a set of
capabilities that describe that ActorSystem and which can be audited
by the Actor's <a href="#sec-5-9">actorSystemCapabilityCheck</a> method to determine if the
Actor is compatible with the ActorSystem.
</p>

<p>
Each ActorSystem may specify capabilities unique to that ActorSystem
and the application can add capabilities to that ActorSystem; in
addition, the following common capabilities are defined for all
ActorSystems:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> <b>Python Version</b> </dt><dd>This is set to the tuple value of the Python
version under which the ActorSystem is running (this is the same
value supplied by <code>sys.version_info</code>).  Any Actors wishing to
enforce any version restrictions use this capability to do so.
</dd>

<dt> <b>Thespian Generation</b> </dt><dd>This is the Thespian API functionality
specifier as a tuple of two values: <code>(generation, enhancement)</code>.
The first value is the <code>generation</code> and indicates a major
functionality level (which is not necessarily backwards-compatible
with the previous functionality level).  The second number is the
<code>enhancement</code> value and is incremented when backwards-compatible
functional enhancements have been added within the current
<code>generation</code>.  The <code>generation</code> value is monotonically increasing,
whereas the <code>enhancement</code> value monotonically increases within a
<code>generation</code> but resets to zero when the generation changes. The
Thespian Release Notes should be consulted to determine what
features are supported in what generations.

<p>
This value is also available to current code in the <code>thespian.api</code>
import as the <code>ThespianGeneration</code> value; if this local value is
different than the ActorSystem provides in the capabilities
</p>
</dd>

<dt> <b>Thespian Version</b> </dt><dd>This is the identifier for the version of
Thespian running in the current environment.  This is a single
numeric value where later releases will have a higher (but not
necessarily successor) value.
</dd>

<dt> <b>Thespian ActorSystem Name</b> </dt><dd>This is the name of the running
ActorSystem implementation.  It is encouraged that Actors are not
written to be unique to any particular implementation, but this
information is present to allow ActorSystem-specific capability
verification.
</dd>

<dt> <b>Thespian ActorSystem Version</b> </dt><dd>This is the ActorSystem version
as a single numeric value (similar to the <code>Thespian Version</code>
capability.  This value may be incremented separately from the
<code>Thespian Version</code> to indicate an update in the underlying
ActorSystem implementation.  The value of a specific ActorSystem
will increment, but different ActorSystems have different version
namespaces and switching from one to another does not guarantee
that the ActorSystem version will increment.
</dd>

<dt> <b>AllowRemoteActorSources</b> </dt><dd>This capability specifies whether or
not this ActorSystem will accept sources loaded via remote
Actor Systems as described in the <i>Actor Code Distribution</i>
section.  Valid values for this capability are:

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> <b>Yes</b> </dt><dd>Any Actor Source validated by a Source Authority
on a remote system can be run on this system as
well (this is the default).
</dd>

<dt> <b>No</b> </dt><dd>No Actor Sources from remote systems will be accepted locally.
</dd>

<dt> <b>LeaderOnly</b> </dt><dd>Only Actor Sources provided by the
Convention Leader will be accepted locally.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Any unrecognized value will be treated as <b>No</b> and will
disallow sources loaded on remote systems to be used in the
current Actor System.  If this capability is not specified, the
default is <b>Yes</b> which will accept sources loaded on any of the
remote Actor Systems that are part of the Convention.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-8-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-8-2"><span class="section-number-3">8.2</span> simpleSystemBase</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-8-2">
<p>
The simpleSystemBase implementation is primarily designed for Unit
Testing and other very simplistic Actor environments:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>All Actors run synchronously in the context of the current
process thread.
</li>
<li>The <a href="#sec-5-9">actorSystemCapabilityCheck</a> is not called for any Actors: all
actors are created in the current ActorSystem regardless of
their capability requirements.
</li>
<li>No support for <i>Multiple Systems</i> (e.g. Conventions)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Specifically, whenever an ActorSystem <code>.tell()</code> or <code>.ask()</code> is
called, the message is passed to the target Actor and any subsequent
actorCreate or message sends performed by that Actor are run in
sequence, etc. recursively.  When the <code>.tell()</code> or <code>.ask()</code>
completes back to the caller, most messages have been propagated
through the system and it has reached equilibrium.
</p>

<p>
There is one exception to the equilibrium state: pending <a href="#sec-5-5">wakeupAfter</a>
wakeups.  These wakups may still be pending when the <code>.tell()</code> or
<code>.ask()</code> returns, and will not be delivered in the background
subsequent to that return.  If the wakeup time period expires during
a future call to <code>.tell()</code> or <code>.ask()</code> then the <code>WakeupMessage</code> will
be delivered at that point.  Wakeup periods that expire in the
interim are not acted upon until a future <code>.tell()</code> or <code>.ask()</code>, and
if no future calls of this type are made then those wakeups are
never delivered.

The simpleSystemBase uses the following <i>ActorSystem Capabilities</i>:

<h3 id="sec-8-3"><span class="section-number-3">8.3</span> multiprocQueueBase</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-8-3">
<p>
The multiprocQueueBase runs each Actor in its own separate process
for a truly asynchronous system.  The default Actor communication
method is by utilizing multiprocess Queue objects.  The Actors are
constrained to the current system, which is unique to the starting
process. There is no inter-system communications possible, nor sharing
of the Actor System with processes that are siblings of the starting
process (i.e. not started by the ActorSystem itself).
</p>

<p>
The multiprocQueueBase System Base is used between all processes
that were created from the original creation of the SystemBase, but a
new SystemBase is created by each initiating process and the Queues
are unique between the different SystemBase elements.  The lifetime of
the Actor System is limited to the lifetime of the process that
created it.
</p>

<p>
The multiprocQueueBase uses Python's multiprocess Queue objects, but
due to the fact that these Queues can only be passed by direct process
inheritance and not via pickling, this system base can be somewhat
inefficent due to the manner in which this implementation must route
messages through a chain of actor processes from source to
destination.
</p>

<p>
The multiprocQueueBase can only be used for communications on the
current system and not for inter-system communications.  The
multiprocQueueBase does not support the use of multiple ActorSystems
in a Convention as described in <i>Multiple Systems</i>.
</p>

<p>
The multiprocQueueBase uses the following <i>ActorSystem Capabilities</i>:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> <b>Thespian ActorSystem Name</b> </dt><dd>"multiprocQueueBase"

<p>
The multiprocTCP SystemBase is shared between all processes that
utilize the same Administrator coordinates, and can be used for
inter-system communications.  The lifetime of the Actor System exceeds
that of the process that started it and persists until an explicit
shutdown.
</p>

<p>
The multiprocTCPBase can be used for Actors on the same system or on
other systems accessible via TCP/IPv4.

port, then the existing system will be utilized; otherwise a new
multiprocTCPBase ActorSystem will be started up.
</p>

</p>
</dd>

<dt> <b>Convention Address.IPv4</b> </dt><dd>the IPv4 address of the convention
leader's Admin.  This should be specified either as a tuple of
<i>(hostname, portnum)</i> or as a string of the form

not specified (no colon is found) then the port num defaults to
the <b>Admin Port</b> setting.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-8-5">
<p>
The multiprocUDPBase runs each Actor in its own separate process
for a truly asynchronous system.  The default Actor communication
method is by utilizing UDP messages.

The multiprocUDP SystemBase is shared between all processes that
utilize the same Administrator coordinates, and can be used for
inter-system communications.  The lifetime of the Actor System
exceeds that of the process that started it and persists until an
explicit shutdown.
</p>

<p>
As with most UDP-based exchanges, there is no guarantee that messages
have been delivered.  One effect of this is that it is often difficult
for the ActorSystem to recognize that Actors have exited and so Dead
Letter delivery is unreliable at best for this system base.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, the UDP-based ActorSystem can only exchange messages up
to 64KiB in size.  Larger messages will fail.
</p>

<p>
The multiprocUDPBase can be used for Actors on the same system or on
other systems accessible via UDP/IP.
</p>

<p>
Possible Methods for deployment:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Create a virtualenv via os-specific packaging (e.g. RPM) of all
dependencies including Thespian.  This is a single, self-contained
installation containing all needed elements and can be started and
stopped distinctly.
</li>

<li>Distribute Thespian and a Source Authority via os-specific
packaging to make the ActorSystem available.  This establishes the
base service and other elements can be deployed via the
loadActorSource() operation.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The former method is a simpler method, but it means that the
ActorSystem cannot be shared amongst separate applications, and that
any deployment will completely shutdown the previous ActorSystem and
Actors before starting the new one.
</p>

<p>
Using the latter method is slightly more complicated from a
packaging complexity perspective, but it allows the ActorSystem to
be shared by multiple Actor-based applications, as well as providing
for seamless upgrades of each application (because the new and old
sources can be running simultaneously).

On systems where a user has local root access but that user is not a

The PEP302 Python extension specification defines the

the Python <code>import</code> statement.  The Thespian <code>loadActorSource</code>
implements a PEP302-compliant package manager.  All loaded packages

Note that this can result in behavioral
differences between in-process and multi-process ActorSystems:
unloaded sources are still present in still-existing multi-process
Actors and so import statements and other references will still
succeed in those Actors even after the source has been unloaded.  In
general it is recommended that all Actors running within a loaded
source have exited before the source is unloaded, so this behavioral
difference will remain unaddressed.
