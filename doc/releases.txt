2.1
───

2.3.0 <2015-10-04 Sun>
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  ‣ Added ActorTypeDispatcher enhanced base class to facilitate
    dispatching of received messages based on message type.

  ‣ Ensure exceptions occuring while writing to Thespian file log do not
    cause failures.

  ‣ Protect against exceptions occurring when comparing messages for
    equality.

  ‣ Updates to testActorSystemRestart.

  ‣ Update "Thespian Generation" common Capabilities to version (2,3).
    Previous 2.2.0 release erroneously did not update this value.


2.2.0 <2015-09-27 Sun>
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  ‣ Fix internal links in Using Thespian document.

  ‣ Add support for multiple convention notification registrations.

  ‣ Allow ActorSystem logDefs to be specified as False to suppress any
    logging configuration; especially useful for test log capture modes.

  ‣ Better ActorSystem startup processing to distinguish between a
    re-specification of the current base and a new base, and added the
    transientUnique startup argument to get a plain instance (a
    non-global-singleton instance).

  ‣ Added missing description of the ActorSystem `shutdown()' operation
        in the Using Thespian document.

  ‣ Added ability to set the maximum thesplog logging file via the
    `THESPLOG_FILE_MAXSIZE' environment variable and changed the default
    to 50KB.

  ‣ Added Using Thespian documentation description of logging with the
    `THESPLOG_FILE' and `THESPLOG_FILE_MAXSIZE' environment variable
    controls.


2.1.6 <2015-09-27 Sun>
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  ‣ Fix imports in tests and actors.py for multiple Python versions.

  ‣ Add missing timeout to test to prevent hang.


2.1.5 <2015-09-20 Sun>
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  ‣ Adds support for Python 3.3 and Python 3.4 versions, including the
    use of the PyPy interpreter.

  ‣ Adds the `listen()' API call (`ask()' is `tell()' + `listen()')

  ‣ Log Actor exception through normal logging channels as well as via
    Thespian internal logging output.

  ‣ The Thespian shell loads the TestActor via loadable sources.

  ‣ The simpleSystemBase will always apply default logging.

  ‣ The `loadActorSource()' call can now take a file-like object as well
    as a filename.

  ‣ Added the Thespian Developer's document.

  ‣ Added the Thespian In-Depth Introduction document.

  ‣ Added the Thespian Index (main pages) document.

  ‣ Added the Thespian Releases document.

  ‣ Internal updates to more gracefully handle shutdown scenarios and
    avoid impossible retransmits.

  ‣ Testing, documentation, and setup file updates.
