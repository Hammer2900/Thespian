2.4
───

2.4.4 <2015-12-16 Wed>
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  ‣ Removed TCP connect timeout that overrode non-blocking mode.

  ‣ Fixed TCP address equality comparison when zero port specification
    compared.  A port of zero matches any other port if the address
    portion is the same; previously this only worked for comparing to
    known local addresses, not arbitrary addresses when the port was 0.

  ‣ Fixed error text when using `tell()' with a bad Actor Address
    (previously identified the wrong call).

  ‣ Ensure Actor System `createActor()' calls are not aborted
    prematurely by leftover responses to previous operations
    (e.g. timeout-unclaimed `ask()' responses).


2.4.3 <2015-11-18 Wed>
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  ‣ Ensured that PoisonMessage sending doesn't recurse indefinitely.

  ‣ Added a missing newline in status output formatting.

  ‣ Added a descriptive failure output messaging for IP-based address
    connection failures.  This helps with common mistakes, such as
    specifying the "Admin Port" as a string instead of an integer.

  ‣ Fixed a bug where calling `ActorSystem().shutdown()' multiple times
    would throw an exception.

  ‣ Fixed a bug on multi-level import references (e.g. `import x.y.z')
    in sources loaded by `loadActorSource()' operations.

  ‣ Fixed a bug where old actors checking in with a restarted
    ActorSystem caused exceptions.

  ‣ Fixed a TCP transport bug that caused transmits to be abandoned
    instead of being retried after the back-off timer expired.

  ‣ Updated default thespian.log logfile creation to honor `$TMPDIR' if
    it is set and only default to directing logging to `/tmp' if it is
    not set.

  ‣ Added internal `wait()' call for logger child process on shutdown to
    avoid defunct loggers.

  ‣ Removed a debug printf in the simpleSystemBase.


2.4.2 <2015-10-26 Mon>
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  ‣ Delay thesplog location determination until usage to allow startup
    code to adjust location.

  ‣ Better daemonization of multiproc Admin on Unix.

  ‣ Ensure filenums to close is passed as a list not a Python3 iterator
    when creating multiproc children (bugfix).


2.4.1 <2015-10-20 Mon>
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  ‣ Updated to allow packets not blocked on waiting for an address
    resolution to be sent even if previous packets are still waiting for
    that resolution.

  ‣ Fixed documentation uploads.


2.4.0 <2015-10-18 Sun>
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  ‣ Add loadActorSource() and unloadActorSource() to Actor API
    (duplicating existing Actor System API functionality).

  ‣ Internal: use distributed importlib whenever possible.

  ‣ Fix stats response for Actor Systems for Python3.

  ‣ Allow optional error strings in reporting actor creation failures.

  ‣ Better capture and reporting of loaded source instantiation errors.

  ‣ Miscellaneous test and logging updates.


2.3
───

2.3.0 <2015-10-04 Sun>
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  ‣ Added ActorTypeDispatcher enhanced base class to facilitate
    dispatching of received messages based on message type.

  ‣ Ensure exceptions occuring while writing to Thespian file log do not
    cause failures.

  ‣ Protect against exceptions occurring when comparing messages for
    equality.

  ‣ Updates to testActorSystemRestart.

  ‣ Update "Thespian Generation" common Capabilities to version (2,3).
    Previous 2.2.0 release erroneously did not update this value.


2.2
───

2.2.0 <2015-09-27 Sun>
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  ‣ Fix internal links in Using Thespian document.

  ‣ Add support for multiple convention notification registrations.

  ‣ Allow ActorSystem logDefs to be specified as False to suppress any
    logging configuration; especially useful for test log capture modes.

  ‣ Better ActorSystem startup processing to distinguish between a
    re-specification of the current base and a new base, and added the
    transientUnique startup argument to get a plain instance (a
    non-global-singleton instance).

  ‣ Added missing description of the ActorSystem `shutdown()' operation
        in the Using Thespian document.

  ‣ Added ability to set the maximum thesplog logging file via the
    `THESPLOG_FILE_MAXSIZE' environment variable and changed the default
    to 50KB.

  ‣ Added Using Thespian documentation description of logging with the
    `THESPLOG_FILE' and `THESPLOG_FILE_MAXSIZE' environment variable
    controls.


2.1
───

2.1.6 <2015-09-27 Sun>
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  ‣ Fix imports in tests and actors.py for multiple Python versions.

  ‣ Add missing timeout to test to prevent hang.


2.1.5 <2015-09-20 Sun>
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  ‣ Adds support for Python 3.3 and Python 3.4 versions, including the
    use of the PyPy interpreter.

  ‣ Adds the `listen()' API call (`ask()' is `tell()' + `listen()')

  ‣ Log Actor exception through normal logging channels as well as via
    Thespian internal logging output.

  ‣ The Thespian shell loads the TestActor via loadable sources.

  ‣ The simpleSystemBase will always apply default logging.

  ‣ The `loadActorSource()' call can now take a file-like object as well
    as a filename.

  ‣ Added the Thespian Developer's document.

  ‣ Added the Thespian In-Depth Introduction document.

  ‣ Added the Thespian Index (main pages) document.

  ‣ Added the Thespian Releases document.

  ‣ Internal updates to more gracefully handle shutdown scenarios and
    avoid impossible retransmits.

  ‣ Testing, documentation, and setup file updates.
